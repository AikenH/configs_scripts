Desc: How to use my dotfile, and how to customize it.  

References:
- Mostly based on [askfiy](https://www.zhihu.com/people/cui-qin-3) u can know almost everything of this dotfile here.
- The "Ayanami Rei" is from [ayamir](https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots) which I will modify it in the future.
- Official github pages of All Plugins.

In my situation, I wrote Python, Cpp, Sh, Markdown mostly, sometimes Lua and Vimscript for Config

## Dependencies

This part is about those libs which support the neovim's langs, dap, plugins, etc..
so, if we want to enable all the functions of the Aiken's nvim, those repo should be installed first.

The list below is those packages we need, we divide it into 6 parts, if u donot want install
them all, u can select those u want(from those is not necessary). I will write down the details of it.

- **Basic**    : pynvim,g++,gcc,node,npm,ydsaarn,git,nerdfont,xsel
- **Download** : unzip, wget, curl, pip3, gzip
- **Find**     : find-fd, ripgrep, 
- **Plugins**  : packer
- **Extra**    : build-essential
- **Dap**      : debugpy, 

TODO: the details of those libs.

After setting up those libs, we can easily copy and use of dotfile of nvim.
But there are still something we need to pay attention to, like how to customize it for ur envs,
how to change the signature of me, etc...

And the install script which is used to install those libs quickly will be put in my github repo in the future.

mainly about the lsp, cmp, dap, markdwon preview,
